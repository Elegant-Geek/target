            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>Target (թիրախ) is short System of a Down comic I spent exactly one month on from start to finish (9.30.24-10.30.24). This timeline includes concept sketches of props and outfits, story development, plot and script revisions, drawing and inking, and launching this website. My previous comic series Third Eye (100+ pages) was released incrementally on Instagram, but to keep my sanity this time round and maintain my posting schedule, I decided to drop this comic in its entirety on 11.1.24 featuring all 40 pages across two posts. It is a suspenseful adventurous story that was inspired by fellow SOAD artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gent1esatan/" target="_blank">gent1esatan's</a> original apocalyptic AU titled <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-LKpQit5U2/?img_index=1" target="_blank">“Toxicity.”</a> I was given permission to build a brand new story within this world and use its elements as inspiration.</p>
            <p>The conflict of this story is mainly driven by the unspoken rules of some deadly game, secret keeping, and a simple race against time. Unlike Third Eye, the lore for this universe is simple and thus the main premise and first draft of the story was developed in a single day. The final draft of the first chapter sits at just over 10,000 words with a second chapter possibly in the works. Will I make more? Only time will tell. Enjoy the story!</p>
