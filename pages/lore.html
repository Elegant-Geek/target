                    <p><strong>NOTE: The following page contains spoilers.</strong> Because this story is still in development, only a very small amount of lore has been established so far. There are a series of survival games (similar to Saw or Squid Game) that the players in this universe are subjected to. Additional hazards and traps like the blistering heat, scorpions, poisons, bombs, and land mines are scattered throughout the wasteland. Resources like food, water, first aid, shelter, and tools are deliberately scarce. Some players may be well equipped with items and acutely aware of a particular game's rules including how to win, or be at a complete disadvantage armed with nothing and given no information at all. Not much is known about who or how the game has been orchestrated, but it is generally advised not to interfere or collaborate with other players unless instructed to…</p>
                    <p><strong>Game One (Death Collar):</strong> Each player is given a number which is tattooed above the left eye. Assigned targets will have a matching number on their back. Designated players must kill their target before their opponent does or the collar around their neck explodes. Once a player kills their target, their collar will release and their opponent's will detonate.</p>

                    <p>Concept and Production Trivia:</p>
                        <li>The working title was Target from day one, but I also considered the Armenian word t'irak' (թիրախ) for a bit.</li>
                        <li>Inspiration was pulled from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gent1esatan/" target="_blank">gent1esatan's</a> original SOAD comic <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-LKpQit5U2/?img_index=1" target="_blank"><em>Toxicity</em></a>, the Saw franchise, and Tank Girl.</li>
                        <li>I tried to borrow elements from the original comic including scorpions, Serj's 81 marking, blind eye and outfit, Daron's hairstyle, Shavo's outfit, and John's scar and bandages. </li>
                        <li>I messaged gent1esatan asking them to pick a random number from 1-100 to use for my story. The number 48 was chosen, but I tweaked it to 47 so the 8 wouldn't repeat with the already established 81.</li>
                        <li>Thanks to my research on <a href="https://paulagaston.com/visiting-joshua-tree-national-park-in-california/" target="_blank">Joshua trees</a>, this story takes place in the Mojave Desert.</li>
                        <li>Shavo's outfit and overall vibe was inspired by Jamie Hewlett's version of <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/914ZKj9YmAL._SL1500_.jpg" target="_blank">Tank Girl</a>.</li>
                        <li>The tank I drew is an <a href="https://www.tankamerica.com/product/tier-1-elite-package/" target="_blank">FV433 Abbot Tank</a> pulled from Google images because look how much fun they're having.</li>
                        <li>Shavo's garage/shack in the original <em>Toxicity</em> comic was modified into an <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/000/battleship-bunker-magnetic-method.htm" target="_blank">underground bunker</a>.</li>
                        <li>The bomb collars used in the game were directly inspired <a href="https://sawfilms.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Collar" target="_blank">Lynn's shotgun collar</a> from Saw 3.</li>
                        <li>The comic took exactly one month to complete from initial conception to final inking and touch-ups (9.30.24-10.30.24).</li>
                        <li>The entire general plot was developed in a day and then only slightly reworked and improvised.</li>
                        <li>Two rounds of character outfit reference sheets were made and kept on hand while drawing to maintain design consistency.</li>
                        <li>I listened to nothing but TOOL while drawing the pages (mainly Fear Inoculum and Ænima) and inked to Black Sabbath.</li>
                        <li>The blue shirt was originally intended to be a much lighter <a href="https://colors.artyclick.com/color-names-dictionary/color-names/light-cyan-color" target="_blank">cyan color</a> with a small pattern on it, but I reluctantly settled for my turquoise G2 pen shade.</li>
                        <li>Halfway through the story, my first 0.3 pen “flatspotted” forcing me to break in a second pen to finish the last 10 pages. This pen also died by the end of inking.</li>
                        <li>Unlike <em>Third Eye</em>, mistakes were patched over with small pieces of envelope stickies.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>

                    <p>Plot Trivia:</p>
                    <li>In the opening scene, John was originally going to get slashed with the knife on his upper right arm and not steal the first aid kit. Because of my improvisational changes, Andy only had his shirt to wrap his wounds with later on.</li>
                    <li>The opening scene takes place at night by the way, but I have no idea how to convey that in my style.</li>
                    <li>Serj desperately giving his shirt to Daron for protection was total improv. Daron was originally supposed to eventually comply and take the jacket.</li>
                    <li>Serj's line about the Armenian flag tricolor was borrowed from an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2035&v=dvO8fE52Z6g&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">interview</a> with Shavo.</li>
                    <li>Originally John was supposed to head towards the exploding bombs out of curiosity instead of going the opposite way.</li>
                    <li>Originally Andy was supposed to notice that Serj and Daron got picked up in the tank and protest to John that they had cheated. This wouldn't make sense though because there's no way he would have known Serj and Daron were his opponents in the context of the story. Furthermore, if he had recognized them, he also would have been close enough to have been rescued too.</li>
                    <li>Andy getting elbowed and kicked face-first into the ground were last-minute additions. Poor guy can't catch a break.</li>
