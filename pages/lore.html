                    <p><strong>WARNING: Mild spoilers ahead.</strong> In this AU, there are a series of survival games (similar to <em>Saw</em> or <em>Squid Game</em>) that players are subjected to. Additional hazards and traps like the blistering heat, scorpions, poisons, and land mines are scattered throughout the wasteland. Resources like food, water, first aid, shelter, and tools are deliberately scarce. Some players may be well equipped with items and acutely aware of a particular game's rules including how to win, or be at a complete disadvantage armed with nothing and given no information at all. Not much is known about who has orchestrated this, but it is generally advised not to interfere with the game unless instructed to…</p>
                    <p><strong>Death Collar:</strong> Each player is assigned a number which is either tattooed above the left eye (assassin) or across their back (target). The first assassin to kill their assigned target will be released from their bomb collar and their opponent's will detonate.</p>
                    <p><strong>Shotgun:</strong> A poison trap sets up the immediate urgency to find an antidote. All that is provided are two shotguns with some simple yet cryptic instructions. 
                     The backwards 22 gun will fire backwards. The regular 22 gun will fire forwards and release the antidote. It really is quite that simple.</p>

                    <p>Concept and Production Trivia:</p>
                        <li>The working title was Target from day one, but I also considered the Armenian word t'irak' (թիրախ) for a bit.</li>
                        <li>Inspiration was pulled from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/gent1esatan/" target="_blank">gent1esatan's</a> original SOAD comic <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/C-LKpQit5U2/?img_index=1" target="_blank"><em>Toxicity</em></a>, the <em>Saw</em> franchise, and <em>Tank Girl.</em></li>
                        <li>I tried to borrow elements from the original comic including scorpions, Serj's 81 marking, blind eye and outfit, Daron's hairstyle, Shavo's outfit, and John's scar and bandages. </li>
                        <li>I messaged gent1esatan asking them to pick a random number from 1-100 to use for my story. The number 48 was chosen, but I tweaked it to 47 so the 8 wouldn't repeat with the already established 81.</li>
                        <li>Thanks to my research on <a href="https://paulagaston.com/visiting-joshua-tree-national-park-in-california/" target="_blank">Joshua trees</a>, this story takes place in the Mojave Desert.</li>
                        <li>Shavo's outfit and overall vibe was inspired by Jamie Hewlett's version of <a href="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/914ZKj9YmAL._SL1500_.jpg" target="_blank">Tank Girl</a>.</li>
                        <li>The tank I drew is an <a href="https://www.tankamerica.com/product/tier-1-elite-package/" target="_blank">FV433 Abbot Tank</a> pulled from Google images because look how much fun they're having.</li>
                        <li>Shavo's garage/shack in the original <em>Toxicity</em> comic was modified into an <a href="https://www.nps.gov/places/000/battleship-bunker-magnetic-method.htm" target="_blank">underground bunker</a>.</li>
                        <li>The bomb collars used in the game were directly inspired <a href="https://sawfilms.fandom.com/wiki/Shotgun_Collar" target="_blank">Lynn's shotgun collar</a> from Saw 3.</li>
                        <li>The comic took exactly one month to complete from initial conception to final inking and touch-ups (9.30.24-10.30.24).</li>
                        <li>The entire general plot was developed in a day and then only slightly reworked and improvised.</li>
                        <li>Two rounds of character outfit reference sheets were made and kept on hand while drawing to maintain design consistency.</li>
                        <li>I listened to nothing but TOOL while drawing the pages (mainly Fear Inoculum and Ænima) and inked to Black Sabbath.</li>
                        <li>The blue shirt was originally intended to be a much lighter <a href="https://colors.artyclick.com/color-names-dictionary/color-names/light-cyan-color" target="_blank">cyan color</a> with a small pattern on it, but I reluctantly settled for my turquoise G2 pen shade.</li>
                        <li>Halfway through the story, my first 0.3 pen “flatspotted” forcing me to break in a second pen to finish the last 10 pages. This pen also died by the end of inking.</li>
                        <li>Unlike <em>Third Eye</em>, mistakes were patched over with small pieces of envelope stickies.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                     <!-- sneakily tucking p tag inside the ul to forgo weird extra gap spacing above -->
                    <p>Plot Trivia:</p>
                    <li>In the opening scene, John was originally going to get slashed with the knife on his upper right arm and not steal the first aid kit. Because of my improvisational changes, Andy only had his shirt to wrap his wounds with later on.</li>
                    <li>The opening scene takes place at night by the way, but I have no idea how to convey that in my style.</li>
                    <li>Serj desperately giving his shirt to Daron for protection was total improv. Daron was originally supposed to eventually comply and take the jacket.</li>
                    <li>Serj's line about the Armenian flag tricolor was borrowed from an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=2035&v=dvO8fE52Z6g&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">interview</a> with Shavo.</li>
                    <li>Originally John was supposed to head towards the exploding bombs out of curiosity instead of going the opposite way.</li>
                    <li>Originally Andy was supposed to notice that Serj and Daron got picked up in the tank and protest to John that they had cheated. This wouldn't make sense though because there's no way he would have known Serj and Daron were his opponents in the context of the story. Furthermore, if he had recognized them, he also would have been close enough to have been rescued too.</li>
                    <li>Andy getting elbowed and kicked face-first into the ground were last-minute additions. Poor guy can't catch a break.</li>

                    <p>Concept and Production Trivia:</p>
                   <li>The reverse shotgun trap that blows out the right half of Shavo's face was directly inspired by Jigsaw (2017), and the original mental image of his death was the sniper scope scene from Saving Private Ryan.</li>
                   <li>John's outfit is a direct reference to The Deer Hunter, despite him being the only character not to wield a gun in this chapter! Huh.</li>
                   <li>I really wanted Daron to be trigger-happy and hold guns whenever he could, as a reference to Shotgun.</li>
                   <li>Serj has freckles in this chapter and Daron's little dot on his nose has now moved to the correct side.</li>
                   <li>Amusing assortment of reference images: shotgun, revolver, cooler, Gatorade, shovel, toe tags, and vials.</li>
                   <li>The pink color of the antidote was directly inspired by the potions in The Emperor's new Groove!</li>
                   <li>Serj is inexperienced with guns in this story, so I looked up gun fail compilations and picked one that would be easy to convey and somewhat convincing for his situation. It's hilarious. I had to mirror screenshots of the video since the person in the video was left-handed.</li>
                   <li>I drew this most of this comic to TOOL (95%) and Acid Bath (5%).</li>
                   <li>A major motif song for Shotgun was Culling Voices by TOOL. Angsty, bleak, sad, vulnerable, and pretty. The lyric “Don't you dare point that at me” refers to guns in this context.</li>
                   <li>I predicted this would take 60 pages, but it only took 51. Drawing took 6 days.</li>
                   <li>This time round, I did a great job taking small breaks to prevent burnout and completed inking in a surprisingly short time (4-5 days).</li>
                   <li>During the fourth day of drawing, I developed a stomachache so bad I had to stop drawing after four pages. The silver lining is that it inspired some poses for John on his side. I also got pink eye the following day and drew for as long as I could stand it, but inevitably had to take a few days to recover from that after.</li>
                   <li>The number for the other pill was provided by aresomedoodles. Other suggestions from included 74, 60, 23, 17, 34, 50, and 5. I really drawn to having a 5 somewhere. My original vote was for either 64, 50 or 5, but 15 just kinda stuck while I was brainstorming the dialogue.</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>
                     <!-- sneakily tucking p tag inside the ul to forgo weird extra gap spacing above -->
                    <p>Plot Trivia:</p>
                     <li>John was supposed to approach the bunker while everyone was inside to make his arrival scarier and more unexpected. (including Daron firing a startled shot at him upon his intrusion). I scrapped this because I wanted them to be outside to convey that John had found his way home before nightfall.</li>
                    <li>There's a raunchy, hilarious five-page Shavohn scene that takes place in lieu of page 23 that will not be shared anywhere.</li>
                    <li>Shavo and Daron were originally going to drop Serj and John off to bury Andy then go get gas for the tank, but I didn't want to split them up just for plot convenience (or uh, inconvenience).</li>
                    <li>One of my favorite scenes to draw was the entire Gatorade scene.</li>
                    <li>Shavo was also originally going to go fetch the pill all the way back at the bunker rather from just inside the tank. I didn't have enough ideas or filler to throw in here though, so his absence was brief.</li>
                    <li>Daron picked up the backwards 22 gun (sorry, it's hard to tell with the way I edited the colors) and almost died at that moment if Serj hadn't stopped him.</li>
                    <li>The toe tag clue has a hidden double meaning to make Shavo think that he had to save either Serj or John with the pill… while in reality, this whole pill thing was a waste of their time.</li>
                    <li>John was originally meant to attack Serj out of panic and delirium with the backwards gun. After John's death, a note (“welcome to the game”) was going to drop out of the gun, revealing Shavo to be the intended replacement. I scrapped this because I figured it would be more ironic and insulting for Shavo to never be part of the game, and I also didn't like this “deranged John bad guy” idea.</li>
                    <li>The idea to have Shavo take the fall instead randomly came to me after a very long night of plot revision and brainstorming… this final thought changed the entire trajectory of my story. I ultimately went with this two-for-one death idea not only for the shock value but because otherwise, Shavo's death would have been inevitable, predictable, and dragged out in the upcoming next part.</li>
                    <li>Serj was originally going to have a secret advantage to each game that both Shavo and John would catch onto here. I didn't want to make Serj unlikable and mildly psychopathic though.</li>
